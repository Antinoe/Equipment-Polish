Heavily inspired by Split's Armor Polishing Kit, this mod adds a simple item that allows you to Reforge equipment by hand. Craft it using 2 Wood and 5 Silver Coins, 2 Wood and 1 Gold Coin for a stack of 20, or 1 Armor Polish accessory for a stack of 99.

To use, Right Click the chosen item with an Equipment Polishing Kit in hand. A Reforge will be attempted. If the item is not a Weapon, Tool or Accessory, it cannot be Reforged.
